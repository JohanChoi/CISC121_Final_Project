# CISC121_Final_Project
Take inputs and display subsequent logic and step-by-step proccess of insertion sort

Algorithm Chosen:
Insertion Sort; {Reason} As a personal project, I want to create an application that creates a schedule or “To do-list” by taking user inputs for events and urgency and sorting them based on priority. While there are many ways to sort data, and namely, more efficient ways to sort data, I believe that insertion sort is the best fit for this application as it will be dealing with relatively small data sets, and maintaining the relative order of identical “priority” levels while sorting would be important.
